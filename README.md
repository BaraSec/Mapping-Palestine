# Mapping-Palestine

This was my solution to a dijkstra algorithm project in the "ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS" course in a CS Bachelor program I am pursuing.

It's about implementing a simple yet working solution for finding the shortest path from a Palestinian city/village to another. Added some features like the ability of choosing the locations by clicking on the image points, choosing from the comboboxes, and typing them manually implementing autocompletion. Added the features of instantaneous mirroring which can be turned of, switching between the destination and the source easily, exporting the result to the clipboard, a file, and taking a screenshot.
